   J.A.R.V.I.S Frontend — Main Application Logic
   ================================================================

   ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
   ---------------------
   This file powers the entire frontend of the J.A.R.V.I.S AI assistant.
   It handles:

   1. CHAT MESSAGING — The user types (or speaks) a message, which is
      sent to the backend via a POST request. The backend responds using
      Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing the reply to stream in
      token-by-token (like ChatGPT's typing effect).

   2. TEXT-TO-SPEECH (TTS) — When TTS is enabled, the backend also
      sends base64-encoded audio chunks inside the SSE stream. These
      are queued up and played sequentially through a single <audio>
      element. This queue-based approach prevents overlapping audio
      and supports mobile browsers (especially iOS/Safari).

   3. SPEECH RECOGNITION — The Web Speech API captures the user's
      voice, transcribes it in real time, and auto-sends the final
      transcript as a chat message.

   4. ANIMATED ORB — A WebGL-powered visual orb (rendered by a
      separate OrbRenderer class) acts as a visual indicator. It
      "activates" when J.A.R.V.I.S is speaking and goes idle otherwise.

   5. MODE SWITCHING — The UI supports two modes:
      - "General" mode  → uses the /chat/stream endpoint
      - "Realtime" mode → uses the /chat/realtime/stream endpoint
      The mode determines which backend pipeline processes the message.

   6. SESSION MANAGEMENT — A session ID is returned by the server on
      the first message. Subsequent messages include that ID so the
      backend can maintain conversation context. Starting a "New Chat"
      clears the session.

   DATA FLOW (simplified):
   User input → sendMessage() → POST to backend → SSE stream opens →
   tokens arrive as JSON chunks → rendered into the DOM in real time →
   optional audio chunks are enqueued in TTSPlayer → played sequentially.

   TTS AUDIO PLAYER (Text-to-Speech Queue System)
   ================================================================

   HOW THE TTS QUEUE WORKS — EXPLAINED FOR LEARNERS
   -------------------------------------------------
   When TTS is enabled, the backend doesn't send one giant audio file.
   Instead, it sends many small base64-encoded MP3 *chunks* as part of
   the SSE stream (one chunk per sentence or phrase). This approach has
   two advantages:
     1. Audio starts playing before the full response is generated
        (lower latency — the user hears the first sentence immediately).
     2. Each chunk is small, so there's no long download wait.

   The TTSPlayer works like a conveyor belt:
     - enqueue() adds a new audio chunk to the end of the queue.
     - _playLoop() picks up chunks one by one and plays them.
     - When a chunk finishes playing (audio.onended), the loop moves
       to the next chunk.
     - When the queue is empty and no more chunks are arriving, playback
       stops and the orb goes back to idle.

   WHY A SINGLE <audio> ELEMENT?
   iOS Safari has strict autoplay policies — it only allows audio
   playback from a user-initiated event. By reusing one <audio> element
   that was "unlocked" during a user gesture, all subsequent plays
   through that same element are allowed. Creating new Audio() objects
   each time would trigger autoplay blocks on iOS.

   ================================================================ */

     * Properties:
     *   queue    — Array of base64 audio strings waiting to be played.
     *   playing  — True if the play loop is currently running.
     *   enabled  — True if the user has toggled TTS on (via the speaker button).
     *   stopped  — True if playback was forcibly stopped (e.g., new chat).
     *              This prevents queued audio from playing after a stop.
     *   audio    — A single persistent <audio> element reused for all playback.

     *
     * It does two things:
     *   1. Plays a tiny silent WAV file on the <audio> element, which
     *      tells the browser "the user initiated audio playback."
     *   2. Creates a brief AudioContext oscillator at zero volume — this
     *      unlocks the Web Audio API context on iOS (a separate lock from
     *      the <audio> element).
     *
     * After this, the browser treats subsequent .play() calls on the same

     * callback (like our SSE stream handler).

   SPEECH RECOGNITION (Speech-to-Text)
   ================================================================

   SPEECH-TO-TEXT REDESIGN — PC-FIRST, ACCURATE, AUTO-RESTART
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   Design goals:
   1. Work reliably on every PC (Chrome, Edge, etc.)
   2. Accurate transcription — no duplication or concatenation bugs
   3. Auto-restart after AI finishes speaking (stream + TTS complete)
   4. Single utterance per session — clean, predictable behavior

   Flow:
   - User clicks mic → startListening() → recognition.start()
   - User speaks → interim results shown in real time
   - User pauses → final result → brief delay → send message → stopListening()
   - AI responds (stream + TTS) → when TTS queue empty → maybeRestartListening()
   - After SPEECH_RESTART_DELAY_MS → startListening() again

   Chrome sends INCREMENTAL results (each extends the previous). We use
   ONLY the last result to avoid "hello Ja hello jar..." duplication.

   SEND MESSAGE + SSE STREAMING
   ================================================================

   HOW SSE (Server-Sent Events) STREAMING WORKS — EXPLAINED FOR LEARNERS
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Instead of waiting for the entire AI response to generate (which
   could take seconds), we use SSE streaming to receive the response
   token-by-token as it's generated. This creates the "typing" effect.

   STANDARD SSE FORMAT:
   The server sends a stream of lines like:
     data: {"chunk": "Hello"}
     data: {"chunk": " there"}
     data: {"chunk": "!"}
     data: {"done": true}

   Each line starts with "data: " followed by a JSON payload. Lines
   are separated by newlines ("\n"). An empty line separates events.

   HOW WE READ THE STREAM:
   1. We POST the user's message to the backend.
   2. The server responds with Content-Type: text/event-stream.
   3. We use res.body.getReader() to read the response body as a
      stream of raw bytes (Uint8Array chunks).
   4. We decode each chunk to text and append it to an SSE buffer.
   5. We split the buffer by newlines and process each complete line.
   6. Lines starting with "data: " are parsed as JSON.
   7. Each JSON payload may contain:
      - chunk: a piece of the text response (appended to the UI)
      - audio: a base64 MP3 segment (enqueued for TTS playback)
      - session_id: the conversation ID (saved for future messages)
      - error: an error message from the server
      - done: true when the response is complete

   WHY NOT USE EventSource?
   The native EventSource API only supports GET requests. We need POST
   (to send the message body), so we use fetch() + manual SSE parsing.

   THE SSE BUFFER:
   Network chunks don't align with SSE line boundaries — one chunk
   might contain half a line, or multiple lines. The sseBuffer variable
   accumulates raw text. We split by '\n', process all complete lines,
   and keep the last (potentially incomplete) line in the buffer for
   the next iteration.
